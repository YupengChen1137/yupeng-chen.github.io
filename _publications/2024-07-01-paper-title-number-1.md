excerpt: 'This study investigates behavioral and biomarker changes during the diagnostic decision period for COVID-19, influenza, and GAS using a combination of smartwatch data, self-reported symptoms, and medical records from a large prospective cohort in Israel. It reveals significant delays between symptom onset and testing, with physiological changes detected by smartwatches occurring earlier than symptom recognition, highlighting potential opportunities for earlier intervention. The findings emphasize the transformative role of wearable technology in identifying infections and improving public health outcomes.'
