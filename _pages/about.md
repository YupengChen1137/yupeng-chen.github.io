I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at Stanford Management Science and Engineering (MS&E), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau?tab=bio) and to work closely with [David Scheinker](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-scheinker?releaseVersion=10.9.0). 

🔬 My research interests are in understanding the impact of health policy and improving healthcare delivery quality with computational models.

📚 I received my B.S. in Computational Mathematics and B.S. in Cognitive Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Previously, I was a data analyst at the Center for Health Policy Research at UCLA.
