👨🏻‍💻 I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at Stanford Management Science and Engineering (MS&E), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Margaret Brandeau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/margaret-brandeau?tab=bio) and to work closely with [David Scheinker](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-scheinker?releaseVersion=10.9.0). I'm also a part of the [System Utilization Research For (SURF) Stanford Medicine](https://surf.stanford.edu) group. 

📚 I grew up in Beijing, China. I received my B.S. in Computational Mathematics and B.S. in Cognitive Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Previously, I was a data analyst at the Center for Health Policy Research at UCLA. 

🔬 Research Interests
------
My research focuses on understanding the impact of health policies and enhancing the quality of healthcare delivery through computational modeling. I am particularly interested in leveraging data science, machine learning, and optimization techniques in healthcare settings, both at macroscopic and microscopic levels. Recently, I'm also exploring at the application of causal inference in medical decision-making.


🎿 Personal Interests

I love sports (skiing, hiking, soccer, tennis, long-distance running, and the list goes on), and I love travelling and exploring nature!
