👨🏻‍💻 I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at Stanford Management Science and Engineering.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.
