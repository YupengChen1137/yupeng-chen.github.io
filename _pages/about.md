👨🏻‍💻 I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at Stanford Management Science and Engineering.

🔬 My research interests are in understanding the impact of health policy and improving healthcare delivery quality with computational models.

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

🎿 I love sports (skiing, hiking, soccer, tennis, long-distance running, and the list goes on) and exploring nature!
